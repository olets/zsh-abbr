DESCRIPTION
       abbr  manages abbreviations - user-defined words that are replaced with
       longer phrases after they are entered.

       For example, a frequently-run command like git checkout can be abbrevi-
       ated to gco. After entering gco and pressing [Space], the full text git
       checkout will appear in the command line.

       To prevent expansion, press [CTRL-SPACE] in place of [SPACE].

       abbr-load triggers a reload of the user abbreviations files. This  also
       runs automatically before each of the above commands.


Options
       The following options are available:


       o      add abbreviation expansion or a abbreviation expansion

              Adds  a new abbreviation, causing abbreviation to be expanded as
              expansion.

              Will error rather than overwrite an existing abbreviation.

              Will warn if the abbreviation would replace an existing command.
              To add in spite of the warning, use [--force].


       o      clear-session or c

              Erases all session abbreviations.


       o      erase abbreviation or e abbreviation

              Erases the abbreviation abbreviation .


       o      expand abbreviation or x abbreviation

              Returns the expansion of the abbreviation abbreviation.


       o      export-aliases [<destination>]

              Exports a list of alias command for user abbreviations, suitable
              for pasting or piping to whereever you keep aliases. If a  <des-
              tination> is provided, the commands will be appended to it.


       o      import-aliases

              Adds abbreviations for all aliases.


       o      import-fish <file>

              Adds abbreviations exported from fish.


       o      import-git-aliases

              Adds  two  abbreviations for each git alias: a regular abbrevia-
              tion, and a "g"-prefixed global abbreviation.


       o      abbr list

              Lists the  available  abbreviations  without  their  expansions.
              Equivalent to fish's `abbr --list`.


       o      list-abbreviations or l

              Lists all abbreviations.


       o      list-commands or L

              Lists  all  abbreviations  as  commands  suitable for export and
              import.


       o      rename old_abbreviation new_abbreviation or  R  old_abbreviation
              new_abbreviation

              Renames  an abbreviation, from old_abbreviation to new_abbrevia-
              tion.


       o      version or --version or -v

              Show the current version.


       All options except for clear-session and expand can take a scope:

              o      --session or -S

                     Abbreviations available in the current session only.


              o      --user or -U

                     Abbreviations available to all current  and  future  ses-
                     sions.


       All  except  for  clear-session,  expand,  import-fish, and import-git-
       aliases can take a type:


              o      --global or -g

                     Abbreviation will expand anywhere on a line, rather  than
                     only in command (first word) position.


              o      --regular or r (default)

                     Abbreviation will expand in command (first word) position
                     only.


       All except for clear-session,  expand,  export-aliases,  list-abbrevia-
       tions, and list-commands can be tried without making changes:


              o      --dry-run  Show whats the result of the command would be.


       All except for clear-session,  expand,  export-aliases,  list-abbrevia-
       tions, and list-commands can be run with reduced output:


              o      --quiet Do not log success, warning, or error messages.


Configuration
       The following variables may be set:


       o      ABBR_AUTOLOAD  Should  `abbr  load` run before every `abbr` com-
              mand? (0 or 1, default 1)


       o      ABBR_DEFAULT_BINDINGS Use the default key  bindings?  (0  or  1,
              default 1)


       o      ABBR_DRY_RUN  Behave  as  if  `--dry-run`  was  passed? (0 or 1,
              default 0)


       o      ABBR_FORCE Behave as if `--force` was passed? (0 or  1,  default
              0)


       o      ABBR_QUIET  Behave  as if `--quiet` was passed? (0 or 1, default
              0)


       o      ABBR_USER_PATH  File  abbreviations  are  stored   in   (default
              ${HOME}/.config/zsh/abbreviations)


EXAMPLES
       abbr gco="git checkout"

              "gco"  will  be  expanded as "git checkout" when it is the first
              word in the command, in all open and future sessions.


       abbr -g gco="git checkout"

              "gco" will be replaced with "git checkout" anywhere on the line,
              in all open and future sessions.


       abbr -g -S gco="git checkout"

              "gco" will be replaced with "git checkout" anywhere on the line,
              in the current session.


       abbr e -S -g gco;

              Erase the global session abbreviation "gco". Note  that  because
              expansion is triggered by [SPACE] and [ENTER], the semicolon (;)
              is necessary to  prevent  expansion  when  operating  on  global
              abbreviations.


       abbr e -g gco;

              Erase the global user abbreviation "gco".


       abbr e gco

              Erase the regular user abbrevation "gco".


       abbr R -g gco gch

              Rename an existing global user abbreviation from "gco" to "gch".


HISTORY
       Inspired by fish shell's abbr.
